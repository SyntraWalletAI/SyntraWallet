SyntraWallet  
The intelligent layer between you and your assets.

Built on Solana. Enhanced by AI.  
Syntra observes, reacts, and adapts — giving you clarity, not clutter.

You don’t just see your balance.  
You understand what it means.  
Where it came from. Where it might go.

Transfer tools that think.  
Signals that matter.  
A wallet interface that gets out of your way.

No noise. No distractions. Just sync.

SyntraWallet does not store private keys.  
It is not a financial advisor.  
It’s your on-chain mirror — sharpened by AI.
